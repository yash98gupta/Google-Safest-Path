# LA_crime_and_safest_path
The project aims to predict the crime type in a locality based on latitude, longitude, time of day(morning, afternoon, evening, night), and other relevant features using the Los Angeles crime dataset. Finally, a safest path algorithm is designed to find the safest path between a source and destination similar to shortest fastest path algorithm in Google maps. Machine learning models such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), Logistic Regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Random Forests Classification are capable to predict crimes efficiently. The following strategy entails using effective tools and technologies to predict crimes, classify patterns, and visualize data. The use of historical crime data trends allows us to correlate factors that may aid in understanding the scope of future crimes.
